                AngularJS (commonly referred to as "Angular.js" or
                "AngularJS 1.X") is a JavaScript-based open-source
                front-end web application framework mainly maintained by
                Google and by a community of individuals and corporations
                to address many of the challenges encountered in
                developing single-page applications.
                The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova,
                the framework used for developing cross-platform mobile
                apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the
                testing of such applications by providing a framework
                for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and
                model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along
                with components commonly used in rich Internet
                applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team
                began working on Angular (Application Platform).
                <br><br>
                The AngularJS framework works by first reading the HTML
                page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag
                attributes. Angular interprets those attributes as directives
                to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is
                represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of
                those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the
                code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.

                According to JavaScript analytics service Libscore,
                AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha,
                NBC, Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and
                approximately 12,000 other sites out of 1 million tested
                in October 2016.[3] AngularJS is the 6th most starred
                project of all time on GitHub.
                <br><br>
                AngularJS is the frontend part of the MEAN stack,
                consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web
                application server framework, Angular.js itself,
                and Node.js server runtime environment.
                <br><br>
                AngularJS is built on the belief that declarative
                programming should be used to create user interfaces
                and connect software components, while imperative
                programming is better suited to defining an application's
                business logic.[5] The framework adapts and extends
                traditional HTML to present dynamic content through
                two-way data-binding that allows for the automatic
                synchronization of models and views.
                As a result, AngularJS de-emphasizes explicit DOM
                manipulation with the goal of improving testability
                and performance.

                </h3>
                AngularJS's design goals include:
                <ul>
                    <li>to decouple DOM manipulation from application
                        logic. The difficulty of this is dramatically
                        affected by the way the code is structured.
                    </li>
                    <li>to decouple the client side of an application
                        from the server side. This allows development
                        work to progress in parallel, and allows for
                        reuse of both sides.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        to provide structure for the journey of
                        building an application: from designing the UI,
                        through writing the business logic, to testing.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Angular implements the MVC pattern to separate
                presentation, data, and logic components. Using
                dependency injection, Angular brings traditionally
                server-side services, such as view-dependent
                controllers, to client-side web applications.
                Consequently, much of the burden on the server
                can be reduced.
